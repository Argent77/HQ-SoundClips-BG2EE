## Overview

BG2EE since patch v1.3 contains English soundclips for the BG2EE-specific content in very low quality, which includes voice files for the new EE NPCs and related characters as well as for the Black Pits II campaign.

This mod installs high quality soundclips based on the original files from BG2EE patch v1.2. The files have been optimized to reduce file size to 40% of the original size, by downmixing stereo to mono and using a sample rate of 24 kHz for all clips. The quality difference should not be noticeable.

The mod can be installed in *BG2:EE* and *EET (Enhanced Edition Trilogy)*.
